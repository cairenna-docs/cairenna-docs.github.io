Welcome to the Cairenna developer documentation. This site explains how to run the
platform locally, how the different runtime options (web, mobile, Docker, Unity)
interact, and what the major services and pipelines look like under the hood.

Use the navigation on the left to jump directly to the topic you need. The sections
are grouped into:

1. **Local development** – walkthroughs for each supported environment (Django, Docker,
   React Native, Unity, CLI demos).
2. **Architecture** – high-level overview of the stack, shared libraries, and the way
   data flows between modules.
3. **Runtime deep dives** – detailed notes on the Django backend, `eca_core` therapy
   engine, mobile client, and Unity builds.
4. **Reference** – environment variables, troubleshooting tips, and FAQ.

If you are new to the project, start with [Local Development Overview](docs/local-development.md)
which links out to each setup path.
